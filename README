1. Installation

$ svn co http://adois.org/svn/website/trunk site
$ cd site

# at this point, verify the variables for the python executable inside the 
# scripts

$ make update #this will install all necessary extra packages

# you may want to check "bootstrap.sh" to make sure the versions of each
# package is updated and make modifications if you want/need

That is it.

2. Usage

To launch a test server for the website do the following:

# cd into the django site definition, called 'stuff'
$ cd stuff
$ make all test

Read the extra comments within stuff/Makefile to learn extra things you
can/should do to maintain this website.
